# Motivation

**Rhdf5lib** provides the C and C++ `HDF5` libraries. It is primarily useful to developers of other R packages who want to make use of the capabilities of the HDF5 library directly in the C or C++ code of their own packages, rather than using a higher level interface such as the [**rhdf5**](http://bioconductor.org/packages/rhdf5/) package.  Using *Rhdf5lib* make life easier for users, as they do not have to worry about installing libraries at a system level, and for developers since they can work with a defined version of the library rather than developing strategies to cope with the potential for multiple versions.

**Rhdf5lib** is very much inspired by the [**zlibbioc**](http://bioconductor.org/packages/zlibbioc/) and [**Rhtslib**](http://bioconductor.org/packages/Rhtslib/) packages.*

# Usage

There is an example package,
[**usingRhdf5lib**](https://github.com/grimbough/usingRhdf5lib), that
demonstrates how packages should link to **Rhdf5lib**.

## Link to the library

To link successfully to the HDF5 library included in **Rhdf5lib** a package must include *both* a `src/Makevars.win` *and* `src/Makevars` file.  *Note*: the contents of `src/Makevars.win` and `src/Makevars` are almost identical, but not quite. Be careful of the differences.

Create a `src/Makevars.win` file with the following lines

    RHDF5_LIBS=$(shell echo 'Rhdf5lib::pkgconfig("PKG_CXX_LIBS")'|\
        "${R_HOME}/bin/R" --vanilla --slave)  
    PKG_LIBS=$(RHDF5_LIBS)


and a `src/Makevars` file with the following lines

    RHDF5_LIBS=`echo 'Rhdf5lib::pkgconfig("PKG_CXX_LIBS")'|\
        "${R_HOME}/bin/R" --vanilla --slave`
    PKG_LIBS=$(RHDF5_LIBS)

The statement for each platform modifies the `$PKG_LIBS` variable. If your package needs to add to the `$PKG_LIBS` variable, do so by adding to the `PKG_LIBS=$(RHDF5_LIBS)` line, e.g.,

    PKG_LIBS=$(RHDF5_LIBS) -L/path/to/foolib -lfoo
    
The default behaviour of `Rhdf5lib::pkgconfig` is to report the location of the shared library as the result of `system.file("lib", package="Rhdf5lib")`.  If this is inappropriate for your system e.g. a cluster with a shared file system, use the environment variable `RHDF5LIB_RPATH` to override this and set an appropriate location for your infrastructure.

## Locating the library headers

In order for the C/C++ compiler to find the HDF5 headers during package installation, add **Rhdf5lib** to the *LinkingTo* field of the DESCRIPTION file of your package, e.g.

    LinkingTo: Rhdf5lib

In you C or C++ code files, you can then use the standard include techniques, e.g., `#include "hdf5.h"` or `#include "H5Cpp.h"`.  You can inspect the header files manually to check their names and declared functions.  To find their location on your system you can use the following code:

```{R headers}
system.file(package="Rhdf5lib", "include")
```
